# Flashcards 2.0

## Abstract
Have you ever needed some extra practice to understand concepts? Well look no further then this flash cards game! This easy game lets you quickly study iterator methods and some related topics! For this MOD 2 solo project, students were asked to write a program that allows a user to play through a deck of flash cards but only through the command line. When playing the game, the user will see the questions, the possible answers, be able to take a guess, see if they are correct or incorrect, and will be given a final score.
